# Project-STAR
APPLICATION "STAR" WITH AUGMENTED REALITY


# Goal Of Application
The goal of the STAR application is to create an AR experience that will allow the public to explore the James Webb telescope.

# Overview
Today, we all know about the Hubble telescope. However, it was announced that instead of the Hubble a brand new James Webb telescope will be launched by 2021. That telescope will be more powerful than previous. Also, with James Webb telescope, humanity could find an answers for a lot of questions. Which is why, our team made special application with AR (augmented reality) technology. With that app everyone enable to explore the galaxy with James Webb telescope.

# Solution:
Our application has 3 main functions.

<li>AR observatory</li>
<li>AR James Webb telescope</li>
<li>AR travel</li>

Our team has created a special application which gives a great opportunity to learn about the Jame Webb telescope thanks to the AR technology. In augmented reality, the user can see all the components of the telescope. There we can find information about "optics", "instruments" and "systems". For example, our application has some data about "primary mirror" and "secondary mirror". In "instrument" part user can see "MIRI" and "ISIM". In the last stage as "system" user can see how "spacecraft bus" and "momentum trim tab" work. Of course, if the user turns right, he will be able to see the definition of these things. Moreover, the virtual observatory allows us to explore the route and mission of the telescope. In addition to all this, there is an opportunity to enter the virtual museum where one can find the main objectives of the telescope and all the stands with the names of the planets. But the most interesting thing is that the also user can visit every planet and discover hidden gems of the planets in all directions (360 degrees). Now user can visit all planets from our solar system. Outside, the user sees only planets located in augmented reality. However, they can fully enter the planet and turn their heads there. After all, there is a video of 360 degrees. In that case, each user is able to pass a mini tour of each of the planets.
